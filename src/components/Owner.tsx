          <strong>Pepega</strong>, a beloved internet meme, emerged from the
          depths of Twitch chat in 2018. Born from a simple Discord
          conversation, this green frog with a speech impediment quickly
          captured hearts with its endearing silliness. Initially met with mixed
          reactions, Pepega's unique charm and infectious laughter soon won over
          the online community. Today, it's a symbol of lighthearted fun and
          camaraderie, reminding us to embrace our inner goofiness and find joy
          in the simplest things.
